        <h2>Project 1:</h2>
        <h4>Challenges and Troubles</h4>
        <p>I didn't have too much trouble in this assignment since it deals with aspects of web developement that I'm already familiar with from previous courses I've taken. I did have to look back to lecture code to find how to add links to a page however, so that was one way a worked though an issue I had.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned or Already Knew</h4>
        <p>I already knew how to add things like headings and text to an html file, but I did learn how to implement images and links to a website.</p>
        <h4>Resources that Were Helpful</h4>
        <p>I'd say the most helpful resource for me while completing this assignment was the lecture code. As stated previously, I'd forgotten how to implement a link in a webpage, so having the lecture code to reference back to was helpful.</p>

        <h2>Project 2:</h2>
        <h4>Challenges and Troubles</h4>
        <p>I would say I had the most trouble with flex boxes and wrapping in this assignment. I was able to work through the issues I was having by using the flex box guides provided on the course website.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>From completing this assignment, I improved upon my understanding of how to address html items using CSS. My previous knowledge of CSS was limited, and I'd only used it to change objects like 'p' or 'h1'. Using CSS on classes and IDs helped me understand how useful CSS can be.</p>
        <h4>Resources that Were Helpful</h4>
        <p>The most helpful resources in this project were probably either the lecture code for css or the sources from the course website.</p>
        <h4>What I Had to Google</h4>
        <p>I had to use Google a couple times to troubleshoot some bugs I was having. Namely, I had a problem centering images in the div boxes that I was able to solve by Googling my issue.</p>

        <h2>Project 3:</h2>
        <h4>Challeges and Troubles</h4>
        <p>I found managing DOM manipulations, handling user input and dynamically updating elements on the page to be a bit tricky. Debugging was also a challenge as I had an error with exiting the modal, but I was able to fix this error.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>I learned how to dynamically manipulate the DOM and implement event-driven functions on the user-side using JavaScript.</p>
        <h4>Resources that Were Helpful</h4>
        <p>The most helpful resources in this project were probably either the lecture code for javascript or the sources from the course website.</p>
        <h4>What I Had to Google</h4>
        <p>I had to use Google to fix my error when exiting the modal.</p>
