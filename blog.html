        <h4>Challenges and Troubles</h4>
        <p>I didn't have too much trouble in this assignment since it deals with aspects of web developement that I'm already familiar with from previous courses I've taken. I did have to look back to lecture code to find how to add links to a page however, so that was one way a worked though an issue I had.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned or Already Knew</h4>
        <p>I already knew how to add things like headings and text to an html file, but I did learn how to implement images and links to a website.</p>
        <h4>Resources that Were Helpful</h4>
        <p>I'd say the most helpful resource for me while completing this assignment was the lecture code. As stated previously, I'd forgotten how to implement a link in a webpage, so having the lecture code to reference back to was helpful.</p>
